    	<h2> Overview:</h2>
        <p>
        	In this project, I had implemented functions that used sets of points to manipulates them to create
			Bezier curves, and then converting those curves to surfaces utilizing de Casteljau's algorithm. I had 
			also learned how to smooth meshes, flip and split edges of meshes and then use loop subdivision to upsample 
			those meshes to make it look higher res. This project used a lot of pointers and through having to use them
			I learned a lot about pointer manipulation as well.

        <h3 id="part1">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>
        <p>The main implementation of this function was to create de Casteljau's algorithm, a recursive algorithm used to evaluate 
            the polynomials used to represent Bezier Curves. Using n control points (the points used to define the Bezier Curve) and 
            a parameter t (which is used to evaluate the curve), we can utilize linear interpolation to compute n - 1 points, and 
            then keep calling this function to eventually come to a single point that lies on the Bezier curve. The parameter t gives 
            us information about where on the curve the point is, so if we have points x0 and x1, when t is 0, the point is on x0, 
            when t is 0.5, it would be in the middle between x0 and x1, and when t is 1, the point would be on x1. I was able to 
            implement this function by looping through elements at index 0 to index n-1, and at each index, multiply that point 
            by (1 - t), and at index + 1, multiply that point by t and then add those two together and place in a new array.

        <h3 id="part2">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
        <p>In the previous part, I had implemented de Casteljau’s algorithm but primarily to define a Bezier Curve. 
            In this part, I had to use that function and extend it to evaluate Bezier surfaces. This was done by using 
            the NxN control points given to us as a class variable. The way to extend the algorithm to Bezier surfaces 
            is by taking each of the n rows and interpreting them as a Bezer curve in the u dimension, then interpolating 
            those values in the second dimension v. Following that logic, I did so by taking each row of the NxN control point, 
            defined by the parameter u, and computing the final, single-point Pi on this Bezier curve at the parameter u. 
            This was done by making repeated calls to the BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...) function, which takes in a row of 
            points and interpolates to a final point. So in total, there would be N of these points to represent the Bezier 
            curves. Then, we make a final call to BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...) and pass in those u points to be evaluated at 
            the v dimension.

        <h2>Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

        <h3 id="part3">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>
        <p>In this part, I had to calculate the area-weighted normal vector at a specific vertex. 
            This allows us to provide better shading for surfaces that are smooth rather than flat shading. 
            At each vertex, we have half-edges, which allows us to be able to iterate through each face of the 
            vertex then for each face I was able to weigh its normal by its area, and then get the overall normal 
            of the vertex, I normalize the sum of all the area-weighted normals. Since each face is a triangle, I was 
            able to implement this logic by finding each vertex of the triangle by calling vertex()->position, saving 
            each vertex of the triangle, computing the cross product of each face, and then adding that to our cumulative face. 
            When we have gone through all the faces, then we can just call normalize() on our cumulative vector and then return that.

        <h3 id="part4">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
        <p>In this part, I had to “flip” an edge, which is basically taking a pair of triangles and creating a new pair of triangles. 
            For example, (this example is taken from the project spec at: https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp24/docs/hw2-spec#p4), 
            if we have a pair of triangles (a, b, c) and (c, b, d), “flipping” the edge would cause a new pair of triangle to be 
            created namely, (a, d, c) and (a, b, d). 
            To implement this function, I had to use the Half-Edge data structure, and then reassign all the necessary pointers 
            so the edges get flipped. Using the recommended steps, I first tried out the paper approach where I drew out a simple 
            mesh, such as the example above, and tried to write down the list of all the elements. But trying to write it all out 
            turned out to be difficult because it was hard to keep track of them all but going through Edstem, 
            someone (https://edstem.org/us/courses/50480/discussion/4339350?comment=10286438) had linked this pdf: http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf 
            which make the outline simple and easy to understand. Utilizing the step-by-step process and understanding which points 
            should be reassigned to which one was paramount to being able to complete this part without requiring heavy debugging. 
            After I had got it to work, I started to reduce the number of total pointers I had made so the file would not be as large.

        <h3 id="part5">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
        <p>For this part, I tried doing the similar steps as part 4, where I had to make use of the Half-Edge data structure. 
            However, since this part required the creation of a new vertex, that meant I had to make 3 new edges, 2 new faces, 
            and 6 new half edges as well. Since this part also required heavy usage of pointers, I decided to utilize the diagram 
            from the pdf linked in part 4 and then tried to see how the pointers would change after splitting an edge. 
            Since this required adding in new elements, trying to figure out where every new element would go and how current 
            elements would change was difficult. However, creating new references to every single pointer and making sure 
            they were labeled correctly helped out a lot when trying to implement this function. After I was able to implement 
            it correctly, to make sure the file didn’t get too large, I reduced the number of total pointers I used.

        <h3 id="part6">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
        <p>In order to implement this part, I had to first loop through all the vertices and edges, and make them as not new to make 
          sure that I had a mesh that was not new at all. Then I looped through all the vertices and got each vertice's degrees so I 
          could compute new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh and then mark each vertex as being part of the original mesh
          so when we subdivide and create new vertex, we know which one is new and not. I was able to update the position by 
          ((1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum) where n is the vertex degree and u = 3/16 if n = 3 and 
          3/(8n) otherwise. After doing that, I computed the new edge positions by looping through each edge. Then I had to split every 
          edge in the mesh but only if their vertices were old so we would not split any new edges. Then, I went through the edges again
          and flipped the edges if they were connected to a new vertex and an old vertex and if the edge was new. Then lastly, I updated
          all the vertex position to the position stored in the Vertex::newPosition variable. Trying to debug this was pretty difficult
          since there were two other functions that could be erroring so it took a lot of trial and error and making sure every function
          was working as intended.</p>
          <p>
            After loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges are gradually lessened and also this could be reduced by pre-splitting some edges
            since that produces a sharper image.
