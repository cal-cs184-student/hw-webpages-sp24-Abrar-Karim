    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I implemented real-time cloth simulation that can detect self-collision as well as collision with other 
      primitives (such as a sphere). On top of that, I had built several shaders to change the visual look in order to be able to 
      stylize the simulation. The simulator was essentially built on equations of motions (such as mass, springs and force) and a 
      cloth data structure. This data structure is modeled as a 2D grid of point masses and were connected by different springs 
      such as structural, shearing and bending.

    Overview of Implementation
  </b></blockquote>
  <p>Like stated in the overview, the data structure is modeled as a 2D grid of point masses. This was done in this section. 
    Each cloth has an input width and height as well as the number of PointMasses that would be needed to represent the cloth, 
    stored in the num_width_points and num_height_points variables. I implemented this function by having a nested for loop, 
    first iterating through the num_height_points and then the nested for loop being an iteration through num_width_points, since 
    we wanted the points to be in row-major order. Then for each point, I checked if the cloth is horizontal (same y value) in which 
    case I would set the point’s position’s y-value to be 1.0 so the points have the uniform height. If the cloth was vertical, then 
    I would set the point’s position’s z-value to a random offset between 1/1000 and -1/1000 so all point masses end up falling to 
    either side of the starting position to mimic real cloth. In addition to this, each point has a pinned variable which indicates 
    if the point should be moved or not during simulation steps. Then this point would be added to the cloth data structure's 
    point_masses vector.
    After that, I have to add the different springs. There are three different types of springs: Structural, Shearing, and Bending. 
    I looped through the cloth’s point_masses and connected point_masses using their respective spring if the condition was met.</p>

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  </a>
  <blockquote><b>
    Overview of Implementation
  </b></blockquote>
  <p>
    This part of the project was to simulate how the cloth would move over time. In this simulation, we have two primary forces 
    that affect objects: external forces and spring correction forces. External forces exert uniform force to all objects in the 
    scene (an example could be gravity). Spring correction forces affect each point differently based on the spring type.
    I implemented this part by going through each point_mass and added the total external force exert on it by using Newton’s 
    second law (Force = mass * acceleration). Then in order to apply the spring correction forces, I iterated through the 
    point_masses again and used Hooke’s law to calculate the force applied to the two point_masses attached. However, if the 
    spring was a bending type, then I used a smaller spring constant.
    After that, we have to figure out where the new point masses will be after they get affected by the forces. I did this by 
    using Verlet integration. I iterated through each point_mass, checked if it was pinned or not (because if it was pinned, 
    then the point is not allowed to move), and then calculated the new position using the Verlet integration formula.
    Lastly, I made sure that the distance between the two points of a string was never greater than 10% of the spring's resting 
    length. I did this by looping through each spring and if neither of the spring’s points are pinned, then I corrected both 
    point positions. If only one of the points were pinned, then I would correct the other point. This correction value was the 
    current distance between the points multiplied by the difference between the max distance (10%).

      Ks is the spring constant in Hooke’s law and it’s used to measure how stiff a spring would be. Since it is uniformly 
      applied to all springs, I noticed that with a lower ks value, the springs would be “stretchier” and with a higher ks value, 
      the springs would be “tighter”.

      Density is the mass per unit area of the cloth. Using physics knowledge, I had a feeling that with a lower density, 
      the external forces would have a lower impact (since the force formula uses mass so if we decrease mass for the same 
      acceleration value, force will decrease). Thus, with a lower density, the cloth is less susceptible to gravity and isn’t 
      sagging down as much (the curve at the top middle is decreased). However, with a higher density, it is more affected by 
      gravity so it will sag down more (the curve at the top middle is increased).

      Damping is used to simulate energy loss. It was hard to capture it in photos but during the actual simulation, it seemed 
      like the damping value affected how quickly the simulation reached a state of rest. I noticed that with a higher damping 
      value, the simulation came to rest much faster while with a lower damping value, it took longer. I tried with a damping 
      value of 0 and it took a really long time (about 4-5 minutes?).

  <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  </a>
  <blockquote><b>
    Overview of Implementation
  </b></blockquote>
    <p>
    Like mentioned in the overview, I had implemented collision with other primitives. For this section, I implemented the 
    plane’s collision with spheres and planes only.
    </p>
    <p>
    For handling collision with spheres: Firstly, in the simulate function, I went through each point_mass and checked their 
    positions. If the position was within the surface of the sphere or on the sphere itself, I would update the point_mass’ 
    position so it lies on the sphere’s tangent. Then to find the correction vector, I calculated the difference between the 
    tangent point and the point_mass’ last position. Then to find the new position, I took the correction vector and multiplied 
    it against friction and then added it to the point_mass’ last position.
    </p>
    <p>For handling collision with planes: I used the ray-plane equation to find the tangent point of the point and the plane. 
      Then I compare the point_mass’ current position with the last position and the tangent point. If it is greater, then we 
      know the point_mass must’ve intersected the plane. If that happens, then I calculate the correction vector and then 
      multiply it by the friction and add the point_mass’ last position and set the point_mass’ current position to that.

      Here, the differences are slight but noticeable. Compared with the default ks value (ks = 5000), we can see that with the lower
      ks value (ks = 500), the cloth is attaching itself more to the sphere, producing less folds, meanwhile at a higher ks value (ks = 500,000)
      the folds are very apparent and less of the cloth is attaching itself to the sphere.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    Although we have implemented collision with other objects, the cloth isn’t able to collide with itself so if it hits a 
    “floor”, it will just clip through. In order to fix this, I implemented self-collision so the cloth will fold upon itself. 
    This was done by utilizing a hash table to store bounding volume boxes.
    In order to implement this, I first put the cloth’s point_masses into bounding boxes, each containing some number of 
    point_masses. Then using a custom hash function, I hashed each bounding box into buckets. By doing this, I was able to hash 
    every point in the cloth and then built a spatial map that groups together the closest points within a section. 
    These buckets are used for checking points with their nearest neighbors for clipping. Then if the difference between the 
    points, is less than 2 * thickness, the initial point's position is adjusted to be a total of 2 x thickness distance away 
    from that particular neighbor. Then the final position of the point is the average of all the corrected positions divided 
    by the number of simulation steps the cloth sim is running. 
  </p>

      Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself,

      In the low density image, we can see that the cloth is relatively smooth and all the folds are big. In the high density image, 
      we can see there are plenty of wrinkles and there are both big and small folds, and some clipping does occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the low ks one, we can see that the cloth is really wrinkled, which is probably because the springs are really elastic. 
      On the other hand, with a high ks, because the springs were less elastic, there are larger folds.

    <p>
      A shader program is a way to render realistic material appearances on objects without having to have a high end gpu and use ray tracing. 
      There are two different types of shaders that I implemented and that shader programs are built using: 
      1) Vertex shader - which apply transforms to vertices so it can modify their geometric properties like position and normal vectors and it 
      creates varying, which are variables that contain data shared from a vertex shader to a fragment shader. 
      2) Fragment shader - After we finish rasterization, we get fragments which the shaders process. The geometric attributes of 
      these fragments are calculated by using the varyings produced by the vertex shader and used by the shader to produce different material 
      effects.

    <p>
      Blinn-Phong shading is a model that takes in three different types of lighting: ambient light, diffuse light, and specular reflections. Ambient light is the light that is reflecting off uniformly off of all objects in the scene; 
      Diffuse light is the function of the local surface normal relative to the illumination source; and Specular reflection uses the illumination source position, the surface normal, and the viewing position to produce there
      glare characteristic of glossy materials.

    <p>
      Here, we can see that by changing the sphere's coarseness, there is virtually no difference between the bump mappings. However, for displacement mapping,
      with the higher resolution, the sphere looks rounder and closer to the original shape (so it is reducing displacement).
